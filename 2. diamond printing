/**

  The objective is to write a program that takes an integer input $n$ (representing the number of rows in the top half) and prints a symmetrical diamond shape made of stars (*).
  The diamond is composed of two parts:The Top Pyramid: Starts with 1 star and increases by 2 stars per row (to maintain symmetry).
  The Bottom Pyramid: An inverted version of the top half, decreasing back down to 1 star.
